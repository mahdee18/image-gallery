# Responsive Image Gallery with React JS

Hello there! This is my humble attempt at creating a Responsive Image Gallery using React JS. I've incorporated some intuitive features to enhance the user experience:

### Features

1. **Grid Layout with a Focal Point**
   - Designed a grid layout with a distinct feature image, creating visual appeal.

2. **User-Friendly Sorting**
   - Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for effortless image reordering.

3. **Efficient Deletion**
   - Users can delete multiple images with a single click, clearly highlighted for convenience.

4. **Feature Image Highlight**
   - The first image is set as the featured one, easily distinguishable from the rest.

5. **Subtle Animations**
   - Integrated smooth AOS animations to enhance the user interface.
